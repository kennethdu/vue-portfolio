      >I am a recent graduate of a 7 month long intensive programming bootcamp called Epicodus. I also recently completed an internship at a software company called Soro, where I assisted with Front End Development of an internal web application. I love to learn and implement new technologies. Nowadays, you can find me trying to stay on top of technologies by listening to podcasts and reading new articles. I am a big fan of Javascript. I strive to mentor those around me and push to deliver the best possible work</p>
